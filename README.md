Node JS with Microservice concept

- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to create scalable and efficient web applications
- Microservices are an architectural style that divides a complex application into smaller and independent services that communicate with each other
- Node.js and microservices are a good match because Node.js is lightweight, fast, and asynchronous, which supports the development of distributed and resilient systems.
